# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Overview
This project processes smartphone sensor data to produce a tidy dataset.

## Files
- `run_analysis.R`: The R script that processes the data.
- `tidy_dataset.txt`: The final cleaned dataset.
- `CodeBook.md`: Explains the dataset and transformations.

## Running the Script
1. Place `run_analysis.R` in your working directory.
2. Run `source("run_analysis.R")` in RStudio.
3. The `tidy_dataset.txt` file will be generated.

## Notes
- Ensure the dataset is extracted into the working directory before running the script.
- The script uses the `dplyr` package for data manipulation.
